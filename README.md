Reflection

So when I think about what users want, I believe it's all about listening first and then turning what they say into something I can actually build. Writing user stories really helps because it breaks everything down into smaller, clearer goals instead of one big confusing task. It’s easier to stay focused on what matters most to the person using the program.

When I’m developing something, I like to take things step by step. Agile made a big difference for me this term because it keeps the work flexible and lets you adjust fast if something changes. I like the idea of sprints and retrospectives since you can look back and actually see what worked and what didn’t before moving on. I plan to keep doing that in the future because it makes projects feel way less overwhelming.

Being a good teammate, to me, means communicating and being dependable. Everyone messes up sometimes, but it’s way easier to fix things when people are honest and willing to help each other. When the team’s on the same page, everything just runs smoother and feels less stressful.
